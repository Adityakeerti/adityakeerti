Internship
Peerprep — Software Engineering Intern
Sep 2025 – Nov 2025
• Engineered an OpenCV + OCR pipeline with document detection, perspective correction, and text extraction to
digitize academic marksheets across multiple education boards.
• Automated conversion of scanned PDFs/images into validated digital records, significantly reducing manual data
entry effort.
Work Experience
• Commercial Deployment: Solution achieved 100% accuracy and is currently deployed by Integrated Maritime
Exchange.
Projects
AI-Driven Dynamic Credit Limit Optimization (RL) GitHub
Jan 2026
• Implemented an offline Double DQN policy in PyTorch to dynamically adjust credit limits and optimize risk-
adjusted profit under portfolio constraints.
• Built a FastAPI-based decision gateway handling 5000+ real-time evaluations/min with sub-second latency
and auditable inference logs, maintaining portfolio risk below 7%.
• Integrated n8n agents to automate credit workflows, reminders, and operational triggers over simulated currency,
increasing spending efficiency by 8%.
• Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, Reinforcement Learning, FastAPI, n8n, MySQL
DOC OC – Automated Marksheet Extraction System GitHub
Sept 2025 – Oct 2025
• Engineered a multi-board extraction pipeline using YOLO and Table Transformers, achieving 99.98% accu-
racy.
• Developed scalable REST APIs using FastAPI and MySQL with a React frontend for structured data parsing.
• Optimized administrative workflows to reduce processing time by 30x (10 mins to ∼30s) per marksheet; developed
under the guidance of Dr. Prof. Ashish Garg.
• Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI, React, TypeScript, YOLO, MySQL, Microservices
Pustak Tracker – Library Management System GitHub
Aug 2025 – Nov 2025
• Architected a full-stack library solution using Flutter (Mobile) and Flask (Backend) for real-time tracking.
• Implemented secure JWT authentication and automated fine calculation logic to enhance system reliability.
• Integrated mobile-vision barcode scanning, replacing hardware scanners and saving Rs. 4,000 in infrastructure
costs.
• Tech Stack: Flutter, Python, Flask, SQLite, REST APIs, System Design
Achievements
• Winner, MariTHON (National Hackathon): Led team to build a commercialized SOF event extraction tool
using Gen AI.
